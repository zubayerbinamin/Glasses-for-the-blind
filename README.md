# Glasses-for-the-blind

This project helped me win 2nd place among 64 teams in the ENGI 1020 Programming Contest sponsored by Nasdaq Verafin and was also part of my university coursework.

This Python project helps blind users get information about their surroundings and navigate throughout the city. It uses sensors connected to an Arduino to announce the speed and distance of objects from the user and also calibrate step length. It helps blind users with navigation using Python to search, extract, and perform calculations on data from Google Maps to successfully assist a blind user in navigating from point A to B by converting distances and directions into number of steps using the calibrated step length.
